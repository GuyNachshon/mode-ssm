# Research Findings: MODE-SSM Implementation

**Generated**: 2025-10-13
**Context**: Technical research for MODE-SSM brain-to-text neural decoder system

## 1. Mamba-SSM Integration for Neural Signals

### Decision: Bidirectional Mamba with Hardware Optimization
**Rationale**: Bidirectional Mamba provides better performance for BCI tasks compared to unidirectional variants, while hardware-aware kernel fusion offers 15% speed improvements on A100 GPUs.

**Configuration**:
- d_model=512 (matches 512 neural features)
- d_state=64 (optimal for neural signal complexity)
- d_conv=4 (local temporal convolution)
- expand=2 (block expansion factor)
- Mixed precision (FP16 compute, FP32 parameters)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure Mamba: Simple but underperforms on short sequences
- Hybrid Mamba-Transformer: Higher accuracy but excessive computational cost
- Traditional RNNs: May outperform SSMs for short BCI sequences but lack long-range modeling

## 2. Multi-Stage Training Curriculum

### Decision: 4-Stage Progressive Training
**Rationale**: Gradual complexity introduction improves training stability and final performance compared to end-to-end training.

**Stages**:
1. CTC Warmup (10 epochs): Alignment-free phoneme recognition
2. Joint RNNT/CTC (15 epochs): Sequence modeling with alignment regularization
3. Mode Conditioning (10 epochs): Silent/vocalized mode classification
4. Flow Bridge (5 epochs): Optional temporal denoising

**Loss weighting**: L_RNNT (1.0) + L_CTC (0.3) + L_mode (0.1) + L_denoise (0.05)

**Alternatives considered**:
- End-to-end training: Simpler but prone to optimization difficulties
- 3-stage curriculum: Good but lacks denoising benefits
- 5+ stage curriculum: Unnecessary complexity with minimal gains

## 3. Test-Time Adaptation Strategy

### Decision: Cycle-GAN Based Domain Adaptation
**Rationale**: Current best practice (2024) showing superior performance over ADAN alternatives for neural drift handling.

**Implementation**:
- Session-level EMA statistics adaptation
- 3-10 entropy minimization steps on RNNT outputs
- Update only LayerNorm and final encoder parameters
- Learning rate: 1e-5 for adaptation steps

**Expected gains**: 0.3-0.5 percentage point WER improvement

**Alternatives considered**:
- ADAN domain adaptation: More complex training, less robust
- Simple feature normalization: Limited effectiveness for long-term drift
- Adversarial training: Higher complexity without proven benefits

## 4. Distributed Training Architecture

### Decision: Model Parallelism with DDP Fallback
**Rationale**: Split large model across GPUs while maintaining ability to fall back to single-GPU training.

**Configuration**:
- GPU-0: Preprocessor + SSM Encoder + Mode Head
- GPU-1: RNNT/CTC Decoders + Flow Bridge + LM Fusion
- Fallback: Single GPU with reduced batch size (32→16) and increased gradient accumulation (4→8)

**Memory optimization**:
- Mixed precision (bfloat16)
- Gradient checkpointing for sequences >1000 timesteps
- Activation checkpointing (2.7x memory reduction)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Data parallelism only: Simpler but doesn't utilize model size effectively
- FSDP: Overkill for models <1B parameters
- Pipeline parallelism: Too complex for relatively small model

## 5. Mode Conditioning Architecture

### Decision: Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning
**Rationale**: Recent research (2024) shows successful silent/vocalized discrimination with contrastive learning, achieving WER improvements from 28.8% to 12.2%.

**Implementation**:
- Global average pooling for mode classification
- Soft gating with learnable mode embeddings
- Mode-dependent gains on SSM hidden states
- Contrastive loss for cross-modal alignment

**Training strategy**:
- Supervised learning where labels available
- Cross-entropy loss (weight=0.1) for mode classification
- L2 regularization on mode parameters

**Alternatives considered**:
- Hard mode switching: Less flexible, prone to classification errors
- Attention-based conditioning: More complex without clear benefits
- Rule-based mode detection: Not learnable, limited generalization

## 6. Component-Specific Decisions

### Preprocessor Design
**Decision**: Conv1D stem with channel attention
- Z-score normalization per channel with EMA statistics
- 1D convolution (kernel=7) for temporal smoothing
- Learnable attention weights for 512 channels
- Temporal masking augmentation (10-40ms segments)

### SSM Encoder Configuration
**Decision**: 8-layer bidirectional Mamba with residual connections
- LayerNorm before each block for stability
- Dropout 0.1 between layers
- Mode-dependent gating in each layer

### Decoder Integration
**Decision**: Joint RNNT/CTC with shared encoder
- RNNT as primary decoder (better accuracy)
- CTC as auxiliary for alignment supervision
- Shared joint network between prediction and encoder
- 40-class phoneme vocabulary + blank + silence

## 7. Performance Optimization Decisions

### Long Sequence Handling (50ms-30s)
**Decision**: Dynamic batching with sequence bucketing
- Group sequences by length for efficient batching
- Gradient checkpointing for memory management
- Chunk processing for sequences >30s (rare edge cases)

### Memory Management for 512 Channels
**Decision**: HDF5 optimization with memory pooling
- Chunk caching and compression for data loading
- 4-8 worker threads for asynchronous prefetching
- Pre-allocated memory pools for consistent allocation
- Manual garbage collection after large batches

### Training Stability
**Decision**: Conservative regularization with dynamic scaling
- Global gradient clipping (norm=1.0)
- Cosine learning rate schedule with warmup (peak=2e-4)
- Dynamic loss scaling for mixed precision
- Early stopping with 3-epoch patience on validation WER

## Key Technical Risks Identified

1. **Mamba vs RNN Performance**: SSMs may underperform RNNs for short neural sequences
2. **Mode Detection Accuracy**: Silent/vocalized classification errors propagate to final predictions
3. **Memory Constraints**: 512-channel sequences may exceed GPU memory limits
4. **Training Instability**: Multi-stage curriculum requires careful hyperparameter tuning
5. **Neural Drift Adaptation**: 20-month recordings may require more aggressive TTA strategies

## Success Metrics for Architecture Decisions

- Validation WER ≤ 6% after training completion
- Training stability across all 4 curriculum stages
- Memory usage ≤ 40GB per GPU for dual-GPU setup
- TTA improvement ≥ 0.3 percentage points WER
- Reproducible results across different hardware configurations
