# Feature Specification: MODE-SSM Brain-to-Text Neural Decoder

**Feature Branch**: `001-implement-mode-ssm`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement MODE-SSM brain-to-text neural decoder system based on existing architecture design for Brain-to-Text 2025 challenge"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Model Training and Validation (Priority: P1)

Research scientists need to train the MODE-SSM neural decoder on the T15 dataset to convert brain signals into text with competitive accuracy for the Brain-to-Text 2025 challenge.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that enables the primary research objective - achieving competitive WER performance on neural data.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by training on a subset of T15 data and measuring WER on validation set, delivering a functional neural decoder that produces text predictions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the T15 training dataset with 256-channel neural recordings, **When** the system trains the MODE-SSM model, **Then** it produces a model checkpoint with validation WER ≤ 6%
2. **Given** preprocessed neural features and phoneme labels, **When** training with the multi-stage curriculum, **Then** the system completes all training stages without errors
3. **Given** a trained model checkpoint, **When** evaluating on validation data, **Then** the system outputs text predictions with measurable WER metrics

### User Story 2 - Competition Submission Generation (Priority: P2)

Research teams need to generate formatted competition submissions from their trained models to participate in the Brain-to-Text 2025 challenge evaluation.

**Why this priority**: Essential for competition participation and external validation of research results.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading a trained checkpoint and processing test data to generate a properly formatted CSV submission file.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trained MODE-SSM checkpoint and test dataset, **When** generating submissions, **Then** the system produces a CSV file with id,text format matching competition requirements
2. **Given** test data spanning multiple sessions, **When** processing with test-time adaptation, **Then** predictions are chronologically ordered by session→block→trial as required

### User Story 3 - Model Performance Optimization (Priority: P3)

Researchers need to optimize model performance through test-time adaptation to handle neural drift across the 20-month recording period and achieve target WER performance.

**Why this priority**: Performance optimization for achieving competitive results and handling real-world neural signal variability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by comparing WER before and after test-time adaptation on held-out session data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** neural data from different recording sessions, **When** applying test-time adaptation, **Then** WER improves by at least 0.3 percentage points
2. **Given** a model trained on early sessions, **When** tested on later sessions with TTA, **Then** performance degradation due to neural drift is minimized

### Edge Cases

- What happens when neural recordings contain significant artifacts or missing channels? (System skips trials with >10% missing/corrupted channels and logs incidents)
- How does the system handle variable-length sequences and extreme sequence lengths? (System enforces min/max sequence length limits of 50ms-30s with graceful handling for outliers)
- What occurs when test data contains speaking strategies not seen during training?
- How does the model perform on sessions with different recording quality or electrode degradation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-002**: System MUST support both silent and vocalized speaking mode inference through latent mode classification
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement multi-stage training curriculum (CTC warmup → joint RNNT/CTC → mode conditioning → flow bridge fine-tuning) with automatic checkpoint loading to resume from last completed stage on failure
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve predefined train/validation/test data splits for competition validity
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate competition-compliant CSV submissions with chronological ordering
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement test-time adaptation for handling neural drift across recording sessions
- **FR-007**: System MUST support distributed training across multiple GPUs with data parallelism and gracefully fall back to single-GPU training with adjusted batch sizes when multiple GPUs are unavailable
- **FR-008**: System MUST log comprehensive training metrics including loss curves, WER, and computational efficiency
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle variable-length neural sequences and phoneme label sequences with min/max limits of 50ms-30s duration and graceful handling for outliers
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement reproducible training with fixed random seeds and deterministic operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Neural Recording**: Time-series data with 512 features per 20ms bin, contains spike threshold crossings and band power from 4 electrode arrays (ventral 6v, area 4, 55b, dorsal 6v)
- **Phoneme Sequence**: Integer-encoded phoneme labels using 40-class vocabulary including CTC blank and silence tokens
- **Speaking Mode**: Latent binary classification (silent vs vocalized) that conditions model processing
- **Model Checkpoint**: Trained neural network weights with associated metadata (WER, training stage, hyperparameters)
- **Training Session**: Neural data collection session with associated date, block, and trial metadata for temporal analysis
